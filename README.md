## Understanding Threads and Multi Threading

#### What is a Thread ?
- A thread is a lightweight sub-process. 
    - It is the smallest independent unit of a program.
    - It contains a seperate path of execution
    - Every java program contains at least one thread.
- In a process we have one main thread. When our application runs the OS creates a process.
- Basically the <b> Java Virtual Machine (JVM) takes care of your java processes</b> 
- Each and every process has a main thread.

#### Thread Lifecycle

- A Java thread can lie only in one of these states
    - New
    - Runnable   
    - Running
    - Waiting
    - Terminated
